@everyone Welcome to Turnip Talk!

This Discord is to help people make bank on Turnips in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

```

# Post your turnip sell price Sunday before noon.
# Post your turnip buy price twice daily (8 am to noon, noon to close).

If you post a price here, please be willing to open your island for other players to reap the rewards.

```

I made a bot for the channel that helps format turnip prices and has some commands for fun. 

COMMANDS [type without brackets]:

```

[b] [price] [e | p | c | m (timezone, optional)] --- Posts your turnip buy price. Timezone defaults to mountain time.
[s] [price] --- Posts your Sunday turnip selling price.
[stonks] --- Posts the stonks image. Only usable every 15 minutes.
[avg | best | worst] [me | all] --- Posts statz related to you or the whole server.


The following commands are seriously broken but will be available one day:

[calc] --- Plugs your weeks prices into the TurnipProphet calculator and spits out a result.

```

Enjoy!
